# wormgame

In UVA's Introduction to Programming course, students were taught the basics of Python and were instructed to create a game using Pygame and gamebox, a library provided to them to aid in writing their code.

My partner and I created "Worm," inspired by the classic Snake game. The goal is to grow by collecting apples and avoid running into birds.
