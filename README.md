# wormgame

In UVA's Introduction to Programming course, students learned how to code in Python and were assigned the task of creating a game using Pygame and code provided to us to make using Pygame easier ("gamebox"). 

My partner and I created "Worm," which is modeled after the classic Snake game, with some help from TAs. The goal is to grow by collecting as many apples as possible while avoiding the bird.
